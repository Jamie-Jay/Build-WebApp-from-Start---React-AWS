## This is an React App

### Phase 1
1. Work your way through create-react-app [getting started guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/). When you see your hello page, create your first initial commit and push that to your main branch on Github.
2. Create your apps main landing page + what the user should see once they're signed in with dummy data and/or dummy buttons.
3. [Use Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to make something that looks even halfway decent. Read and walk through their [Overview page](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/) to add Bulma to your site. You can also use bootstrap (if you already know how to use that)
